abstract: "Understanding reliable signal transmission repre-sents a notable challenge for cortical systems, whichdisplay a wide range of weights of feedforward andfeedback connections among heterogeneous areas.We re-examine the question of signal transmissionacross the cortex in a network model based onmesoscopic directed and weighted inter-areal con-nectivity data of the macaque cortex. Our findingsreveal that, in contrast to purely feedforward propa-gation models, the presence of long-range excitatoryfeedback projections could compromise stablesignal propagation. Using population rate modelsas well as a spiking network model, we find thateffective signal propagation can be accomplishedby balanced amplification across cortical areas whileensuring dynamical stability. Moreover, the activa-tion of prefrontal cortex in our model requires theinput strength to exceed a threshold, which isconsistent with the ignition model of conscious pro-cessing. These findings demonstrate our model asan anatomically realistic platform for investigationsof global primate cortex dynamics."
