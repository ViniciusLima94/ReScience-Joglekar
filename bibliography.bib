abstract = {{The laminar location of the cell bodies and terminals of interareal connections determines the hierarchical structural organization of the cortex and has been intensively studied. However, we still have only a rudimentary understanding of the connectional principles of feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. Quantitative analysis of retrograde tracers was used to extend the notion that the laminar distribution of neurons interconnecting visual areas provides an index of hierarchical distance (percentage of supragranular labeled neurons [SLN]). We show that: 1) SLN values constrain models of cortical hierarchy, revealing previously unsuspected areal relations; 2) SLN reflects the operation of a combinatorial distance rule acting differentially on sets of connections between areas; 3) Supragranular layers contain highly segregated bottom-up and top-down streams, both of which exhibit point-to-point connectivity. This contrasts with the infragranular layers, which contain diffuse bottom-up and top-down streams; 4) Cell filling of the parent neurons of FF and FB pathways provides further evidence of compartmentalization; 5) FF pathways have higher weights, cross fewer hierarchical levels, and are less numerous than FB pathways. Taken together, the present results suggest that cortical hierarchies are built from supra- and infragranular counterstreams. This compartmentalized dual counterstream organization allows point-to-point connectivity in both bottom-up and top-down directions.}},

abstract = {In a recent series of investigations, dramatic differences in pyramidal cell structure have been demonstrated in the primate neocortex. Initial studies in the cortex of the macaque monkey revealed a remarkable degree of heterogeneity in the structure of pyramidal cells sampled from homologous cortical layers among functionally related cortical areas. For example, there was, on average, a 13-fold difference in the number of spines in the dendritic trees of layer III pyramidal cells involved in visual processing. Moreover, the differences in the complexity of pyramidal cell structure among cortical areas were not random: cells involved in what are generally accepted to be more complex aspects of visual processing had more complex structure. Similar systematic trends in pyramidal cell specialization were found among cortical areas involved in somatosensation, locomotion, emotion, and even in executive cortical functions such as conceptualization, planning, and prioritizing. These studies revealed up to a 16-fold difference in the number of dendritic spines (putative excitatory inputs) in the dendritic trees of pyramidal cells in different cortical areas of the adult macaque monkey brain. Moreover, there are systematic and dramatic differences in the branching structure of pyramidal cells in the macaque cerebral cortex, with neurons in executive cortical areas having significantly more branches than those in sensory or motor cortex. Comparative studies of pyramidal cell structure have revealed some interesting similarities, and some striking differences, in the structure of pyramidal cells in the brains of various primate species. With up to a 30-fold difference in the estimates of the total number of dendritic spines in the dendritic trees of pyramidal cells in the primate cerebral cortex there is considerable scope for receiving different numbers of excitatory inputs. Moreover, the most branched pyramidal cells observed to date are found in the human prefrontal cortex, being, on average, more than twice as branched as those in the galago prefrontal cortex. Thus, species differences in pyramidal cell structure not only influence the number of inputs received within the dendritic tree, but how these inputs are integrated. Here we present an overview of the comparative data obtained from visual, somatosensory, motor, cingulate, and prefrontal cortex of the human, baboon, macaque monkey, vervet monkey, owl monkey, marmoset monkey, and galago. From these data, and those obtained from the archontan tree shrew, one can speculate on the functional consequences of specialization of the pyramidal cell phenotype, and how these may vary between species. New insights into evolutionary and developmental pressures that may shape the pyramidal cell phenotype in the adult brain are presented.}

abstract = {{We investigated the influence of interareal distance on connectivity patterns in a database obtained from the injection of retrograde tracers in 29 areas distributed over six regions (occipital, temporal, parietal, frontal, prefrontal, and limbic). One-third of the 1,615 pathways projecting to the 29 target areas were reported only recently and deemed new-found projections (NFPs). NFPs are predominantly long-range, low-weight connections. A minimum dominating set analysis (a graph theoretic measure) shows that NFPs play a major role in globalizing input to small groups of areas. Randomization tests show that (i) NFPs make important contributions to the specificity of the connectivity profile of individual cortical areas, and (ii) NFPs share key properties with known connections at the same distance. We developed a similarity index, which shows that intraregion similarity is high, whereas the interregion similarity declines with distance. For area pairs, there is a steep decline with distance in the similarity and probability of being connected. Nevertheless, the present findings reveal an unexpected binary specificity despite the high density (66\%) of the cortical graph. This specificity is made possible because connections are largely concentrated over short distances. These findings emphasize the importance of long-distance connections in the connectivity profile of an area. We demonstrate that long-distance connections are particularly prevalent for prefrontal areas, where they may play a prominent role in large-scale communication and information integration.}},

These experiments demonstrate a novel form of cooperativity operating even when postsynaptic firing is evoked by current injection, and reveal a complex dependence of LTP and LTD on rate and timing. Based on these data, we constructed and tested three quantitative models of cortical plasticity. One of these models, in which spike-timing relationships causing LTP "win" out over those favoring LTD, closely fits the data and accurately predicts the build-up of plasticity during random firing. This provides a quantitative framework for predicting the impact of in vivo firing patterns on synaptic strength.}},
